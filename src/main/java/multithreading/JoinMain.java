/**
 * Join method from Thread class is used to impose order on execution of multiple Threads. Here
 * is one of such question, â€œYou have three threads T1, T2 and T3, How do you ensure that they finish in order T1, T2,
 * T3 ? You can do this by using join method, by calling T1.join() from T2 and T2.join() from T3. In this case thread T1
 * will finish first, followed by T2 and T3. You can also use CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier classes to implement
 * scenarios like one thread is waiting for other threads to finish there task.
